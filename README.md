## How I participated in the challenge
I challenged myself to use a different dataset each day and a variety of tools to build charts.
I always gave credit to data source and inspiration.

![circular](DAY11_circular/11_circular.png)  

Would you live or die? Could you guess poisonous or edible by the pictures? Tomorrow I will give names and your chances survive.

![quiz](DAY11_circular/quiz.jpeg)  


## [**Day 12: theme day: The Economist**](./DAY12_TheEconomist) <a id="12"></a>

## [**Day 14: 3-dimensional**](./DAY14_3-dimensional) <a id="14"></a>

Milk calories.
Not a huge fan of 3D dataviz but maybe I‚Äôm not experienced enough. I got inspired by many charts of the challenge. Now, I wanna try {rayshader} R package to build in 3D.  

![3D](DAY14_3-dimensional/14_3-dimensional.png)
